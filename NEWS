(1) fixed two bugs that were pointed out by CRAN:
  The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
   'Transform Counts in RNA-seq Data Analysis'
   In title case that is:
   'Transform Counts in RNA-Seq Data Analysis'

   The Description field contains
     CP, Weiss ST, Qiu W. (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1101/432690>.
     
(2) change functions names:
  logansMat -> lTransformer
  logVTransMat -> lvTransformer
  log2TransMat -> l2Transformer
  logV2TransMat -> lv2Transformer
  rootTransMat -> rTransformer
  rootVTransMat -> rvTransformer
  root2TransMat -> r2Transformer
  rootV2TransMat -> rv2Transformer

(3) add a simulated dataset for example R code
